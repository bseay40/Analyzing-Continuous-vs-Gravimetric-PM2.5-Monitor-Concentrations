# Analyzing-Continuous-vs-Gravimetric-PM2.5-Monitor-PM2.5-Concentrations
An analysis of concentration differences between collocated Gravimetric and Continuous PM2.5 monitors across the United States using data from the U.S. EPA. Various parameters will be explored that could help explain the differences (e.g., temperature) and a ML model is used to predict differences based on these factors.
